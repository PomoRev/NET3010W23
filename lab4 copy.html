            The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of 
            him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his 
            destination. While people may have called it a "bridge", 
            the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden 
            planks held together by rotting ropes. It was questionable 
            whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone 
            the weight of a grown man. The problem was there was no 
            other way across the gully, and this played into his 
            calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk 
            of trying to cross it.
