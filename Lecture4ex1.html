			<h2>Birthday Celebrations</h2> 
		
			<p> 
				Enjoying my time with friends playing boardgames up at the family cottage. 
				Every year I like to have a large group of friends join us at the cottage 
				for a day filled with boardgames, food, and swimming if the lake is warm 
				enough. Often we will have two or three different games going at once.
